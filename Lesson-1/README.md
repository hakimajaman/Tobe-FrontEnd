# Lesson 1

## Introduction to HTML

* What is HTML? [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

### Prerequisites

What things do you need to install for programming an HTML?  

* Web Browser
* Text Editor ( Vim, VS-Code, Sublime, Notepad(Not Recommended), Gedit(Not Recommended) )

## Getting Started

We need a .html file for start code the HTML and in this section, we will show the picture, so, we need to have a .jpg or .png file.

### View the .html file (Introduction to Tag)

**<html>** <-- this is a tag

All of HTML is started with <html> and closed with </html>

**</html>**

Tag is **<>**, and endTag is **</>**

if you open the tag, you need to close it after that.  
some tag is doesn't need to use an open and then close tag, like **<input>** tag. it only needs to use one tag (without open and without close), so, it will be written like this **<input/>**

**<!DOCTYPE html>** this is not a tag, it just tells your web browser that you using a version of html5, and it is always to be the first before of the HTML tag

---

**<head></head>**  
next, we have **<head>** tag.  
this tag is for your web browser tab bar.

---
**<meta />**  
next, we have **<meta />** tag.  
this provides metadata about the HTML document, it will not be displayed on the page but will be machine parsable. [more about meta](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp)
